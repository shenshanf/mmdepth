# MMDepth: A MMEngine-based Toolbox for Monocular, Stereo, and Multi-view Depth Estimation

MMDepth is an open-source toolbox designed to unify various depth estimation approaches within a single framework. Built on PyTorch and the MMEngine infrastructure, it aims to provide a comprehensive solution for monocular, stereo, and multi-view depth estimation tasks. This project follows the modular design philosophy of the OpenMMLab ecosystem, allowing researchers and developers to easily implement, compare, and build upon state-of-the-art depth estimation algorithms.

**Note**: MMDepth is currently in its initial development phase. The repository structure, core interfaces, and basic functionalities are being established. Most algorithms listed in the documentation are planned for implementation in future updates. Your patience and understanding are appreciated as we continue to develop this project.

We are actively looking for collaborators who are passionate about depth estimation to join this project! Whether you're experienced in depth estimation research, familiar with the MMEngine framework, or simply enthusiastic about computer vision, your contributions would be valuable. Please check our [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/en/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details on how to get involved, or open an issue to discuss your ideas and suggestions.
